  <h2 class="h3">Hi! I'm Serena.</h2>

  <p>
    I believe that thoughtfully creating technology can lead to a more inclusive, equitable and kind world. I've been making and breaking the web since 1999, and have been fully plugged into the technology Matrix ever since.
  </p>

  <p>
    Nothing makes me happier than finding elegant, beautiful solutions to large and complex problems. That, and good food, good music and good company is what I live for.

  <h2 class="h3">❤ Communities.</h2>

  <p>
    In the end, it's people who make our products and people who consume them. Hence, I believe compassion, empathy and community-building are non-negotible skills for working in tech. If we foster good communities, we foster good designers, coders, and leaders. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Day to day I mentor our design interns at work. Outside of my day job and <a href="http://serena.nz">side projects</a>, I enjoy volunteering as an organiser for <a href="http://railsgirls.com/wellington">Rails Girls Wellington</a>, as well as mentoring and coaching at various hackfests and student outreach events, such as <a href="https://summeroftech.co.nz/">Summer of Tech</a>. I've also given a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uX9gijsLyzs">few</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEBIEnV5u_o">conference</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWpQDCPc_8E">talks</a>! It's super exciting, and I've learned so much from the wonderful people at all of these events.

  <h2 class="h3">Forever a nerd.</h2>

  <p>
    When I'm stressed I like to go through elegant mathematical proofs. I find the certainty and beauty of it calms me like nothing else. In a previous life I was a theoretical physicist/mathematician, trying to understand how we bridge quantum mechanics with general relativity. I had the honour of studying in the beautiful halls of UC Berkeley, and grew enormously as a citizen of the world during my tenure there.
  </p>

  <p>
    My life in physics taught me a skill I'll never stop using: how to view all knowledge and conceptual models as <em>tools</em> &mdash; instruments I can apply to new, unsolved problems.
  </p>

  <p>
    Other nerdy things I like to indulge in include security, music, reverse-engineering puzzles, world history, architecture, classics, and science fiction shows I'll rewatch again and again inspite of an ever-growing list of the hottest new TV.

  <p>
    While most of what I do involves large-scale redesigns or reconciliation projects (i.e., creating design systems) across entire product suites, my everyday involves obsessing over product strategy, crafting narratives, data quality, and whatever is needed to get practical, positive change.
  </p>

  <p>
    Apart from all of this I run a casual podcast with my friend, work on silly music projects and am getting back into reading Real Books! (Please hold me to this.)
  </p>

  <p>
    I'm currently based in beautiful, tumultuous, tiny New Zealand.
  </p>

  <p>Thanks for stopping by.</p>
